# Professional README Generator 

## Description
This is a node.js application which generates a Professional ReadMe after answering a series of questions. The user runs the program index.js through node and answers the following questions:
- What is the title of your project?
- Please give a description of your project?
- Installation instructions for your project?
- How do you use your project?'
- Which license would you like for your project?'- The user is given the following choices: 
    - Apache
    - GNU
    - MIT
    - No License
- Who has contributed to your project?
- How do you perform tests on your project?
- Please provide your email?
- Please provide your github username?

If a user chooses anyone of these license options (Apache,GNU,MIT), it will dynamically create a License badge and add a License link in the Table of Contents and create a License section in the ReadMe. If the user select 'No License' no badge will be created and there will be no License link in the Table of Contents and no License section in the ReadMe
